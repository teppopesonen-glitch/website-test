        <h3>Mount Kazbek - Georgia</h3>
        <small>July 2025</small>
        <p>Mount Kazbek, towering above the Georgian landscape at over 5,000 meters, is one of the most iconic peaks in the Caucasus. The climb began in Stepantsminda, a small town shadowed by the mighty mountain. From there, the ascent wound through the Gergeti Glacier, a dramatic expanse of ice that tested both stamina and focus. Strong winds at high altitude made every step demanding, but the sunrise from the summit — illuminating the endless range of snow-capped peaks — made it all worthwhile. This climb marked a significant milestone in my mountain journey, blending raw challenge with spiritual calm.</p>

        <h3>Storsteinsfjellet - Norway</h3>
        <small>July 2024</small>
        <p>Storsteinsfjellet, located in the Lyngen Alps of northern Norway, offered an adventure defined by Arctic beauty and solitude. The climb was a journey through snow-covered ridges and deep valleys bathed in midnight sunlight. The air was crisp and silent, broken only by the crunch of boots on snow. The panoramic views of fjords below and glaciers beyond were surreal, a reminder of the untouched wilderness that Norway still protects. Standing on the summit, I felt an overwhelming connection to nature’s raw simplicity — a rare kind of peace only the Arctic can offer.</p>

        <h3>Cotopaxi - Ecuador</h3>
        <small>November 2022</small>
        <p>Cotopaxi, an active volcano standing at 5,897 meters, is one of Ecuador’s most famous climbs. The ascent started from a windswept refuge at over 4,800 meters, where the stars shone brighter than I had ever seen. We set off in the dark, moving steadily across crevassed glaciers under the guidance of headlamps. The higher we climbed, the stronger the sulfur smell became — a reminder that the mountain was very much alive. As dawn broke, the view from near the crater revealed the curvature of the Earth itself. Cotopaxi taught me the beauty of balance between danger and discipline.</p>

        <h3>Santa Cruz Hike - Peru</h3>
        <small>October 2022</small>
        <p>The Santa Cruz Hike in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca is a four-day trek that winds through some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in South America. From turquoise alpine lakes to towering Andean peaks like Alpamayo and Artesonraju, every turn brought a new wonder. The high passes challenged both lungs and legs, while encounters with local Quechua communities added warmth and perspective. Camping beneath a sky blazing with stars at 4,000 meters was humbling. This trek wasn’t just about distance — it was about learning to move slowly and appreciate every quiet, beautiful moment the Andes offered.</p>

        <h3>Huayna Potosi - Bolivia</h3>
        <small>September 2022</small>
        <p>Huayna Potosi, standing proudly above La Paz at 6,088 meters, was my introduction to the world of high-altitude mountaineering. Known as one of the most accessible 6000-meter peaks, it still demanded grit and respect. The thin air made every breath feel earned as we climbed across icy slopes and crevasses under a silver moon. The final summit push began at midnight, with headlamps flickering against the glacier. Reaching the top just before sunrise, the view over the Bolivian Andes was breathtaking — a sea of peaks stretching endlessly beneath a glowing horizon. It was here that my passion for mountaineering truly took shape.</p>
